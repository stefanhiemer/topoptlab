These directories contain application cases of the topoptlab. 

elements

Here I compare elements that are generated by numerical quadrature, analytical 
integration or are simply taken from literature. Typically these cases later 
are transferred to the tests.

fdm

At the moment contains a simple Cahn-Hilliard script which will later serve as 
comparison for FE. There is no plan at the moment, to have extended fdm 
capabilities.

fem 

Contains several application cases where topoptlab is used as a FEM library 
for comparison or benchmarking.

filter

Here I compare filters for bugs or simply to understand what they do. At the 
moment this needs clean-up.

optimization 

Contains simple demonstration of the (constrained) optimizers in topoptlab on
simple cases like the Rosenbrock function to understand and compare performance.

symfem

Here I use symfem to find analytical expressions for the element matrices.

topology optimization

Contains a number of example cases of topology optimization.
