This project provides a collection of topology optimization techniques, many of 
which were originally published MATLAB scripts. The goal is to make these methods 
broadly accessible in Python, in a style similar to the well-known 
*88-line code* by Andreassen and Sigmund. The package can be used in two ways:

- **As a library**  
  Write your own scripts in the concise style of the 88 line MATLAB code.

- **As a modular “black-box” routine**  
  Use the main function in [`topology_optimization.py`](./topoptlab/topology_optimization.py) as a black box function that returns an optimal 
  design once provided with a set of boundary conditions and parameters to run topology optimization directly. If the boundary conditions are already available, then running an optimization can be quite simple. 
  E. g. if one wants to reproduce the famous MBB beam in 2D it amounts to:
```
from topoptlab.topology_optimization import main
from topoptlab.example_bc.lin_elast import mbb_2d

main(nelx=60, nely=20, volfrac=0.5, penal=3.,
     rmin=2.4, 
     optimizer="oc",
     file="mbb_2d",
     bcs=mbb_2d,
     display=True,
     export=True)
```

## Monolithic codes

In the monolithic_code directory, you can find codes that are self contained 
and do not use the topoptlab module written here. These codes are purely there 
to either test new frameworks (e. g. JAX or PETSC) or for 
teaching/demonstration purposes. If you are completely new to topology 
optimization, this is where you start and I suggest to start with the 
topopt88.py.

# Installation, documentation and tests

## Installation with pip from PyPI
Install everything needed for the basic installation, documentation and tests:
```
pip install topoptlab[tests,docs]
```
## Installation with pip from the Github Repository
Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/stefanhiemer/topoptlab
```
and execute
```
pip install .[tests,docs]
```
in top directory. Editable installation (recommended if you want to edit 
something in the code) 
```
pip install -e .[tests,docs]
```

## Run tests
Run fast tests (finish in under one minute)
```
pytest
```
Run slow tests (take a few minutes)
```
pytest -m slow
```

## Make documentation

The documentation can be build via Sphinx 

```
cd docs/
sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../topoptlab/ ../topoptlab/legacy --force --no-toc --separate
make html
```
and displayed in your browser by drag and drop or if you are on Linux
```
xdg-open build/html/index.html
```

## Build package and release on PyPI (only for maintainers and developers)

Make sure the necessary packages have been installed:
```
pip install -e .[pypi]
```
Build the package
```
python -m build
```
and upload via twine
```
python -m twine upload dist/*
```
For testing reasons it may be smarter to first upload on TestPyPI 
```
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
and then install the package via 
```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple \ topoptlab
```
