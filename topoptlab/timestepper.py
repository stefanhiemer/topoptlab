    Get coefficients for backward differentiation formula BDF. Shamelessly 
    copied from Elmer Solver manual.Â´and also check the formula there to understand
    what the coefficients mean.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : int
        order of BD. must be equal or smaller 6.

    Returns
    -------
    coefficients : np.ndarray shape (k+1)
        First one is multiplied with the forces and the stiffness matrix, the others on
        the right hand side with the mass matrix and the history of the function.
