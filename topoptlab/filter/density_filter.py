    The filter in its most basic form is just a blurring filter as 
    conventionally used in image manipulation and can be written as a 
    convolution integral
    
    x_filtered = int K(r,s) x dr
    
    where K(r,s) is the convolution kernel. The commonly kernel used kernel is 
    hat function, but other variants exist as well. The convolution 
    integral is evaluated here in two different variations: i) discretize the 
    integral and

        ----------

            number of elements in y direction.

            said matrix with the densities/sensitivities.
