These directories contain application cases of the topoptlab. 

elements

Here I compare elements that are generated by numerical quadrature, analytical 
integration or are simply taken from literature. Typically these cases later 
are transferred to the tests later on.

fdm

A couple of examples as comparison for FE. There is no plan at the moment, to 
have extended fdm capabilities.

fem 

Contains several application demonstration cases where topoptlab is (ab)used as 
a FEM library for comparison or benchmarking.

filter

Here filters are compared to understand/illustrate what they do.

linsolvers

Demonstrates different solvers for linear systems. 

optimization 

Contains simple demonstration of the (constrained) optimizers in topoptlab on
simple cases like the Rosenbrock function to understand and compare performance.

symfem

Here symfem is used to find analytical expressions for the element matrices. 
This can be quite useful if one has an expression of the material properties 
as a function of microstructure parameters (e. g. laminates). The TO problem 
can then be formulated in terms of the microstructural parameters instead of 
generic relative densities.


topology optimization

Contains a number of example cases of topology optimization.
