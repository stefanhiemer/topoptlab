These directories contain application cases of the topoptlab. 

## `elements`

Here I compare elements that are generated by numerical quadrature and 
analytical integration. If one creates new elements, I suggest to start there 
and perform similar comparisons before moving these comparisons to the tests.

## `fdm`

A couple of examples as comparison for FE. There is no plan at the moment, to 
have extended fdm capabilities.

--- 

## `fem` 

Contains several application demonstration cases where topoptlab is (ab)used as 
a FEM library. As TO first needs to solve the underlying physical problem, this is 
the first step when applying TO to a new physical problem. 

--- 

## `filter`

Here filters are compared to understand/illustrate what they do.

--- 

## `linsolver`

Demonstrates different solvers for linear systems. 

--- 

## `optimization`

Contains simple demonstration of the (constrained) optimizers in topoptlab on
simple cases like the Rosenbrock function to understand and compare performance.

--- 

## `symfem`

Here symfem is used to find analytical expressions for the element matrices. 
This can be quite useful if one has an expression of the material properties 
as a function of microstructure parameters (e. g. laminates). The TO problem 
can then be formulated in terms of the microstructural parameters instead of 
generic relative densities.

## `topology optimization`

Contains a number of example cases of topology optimization.
