bodyforce.py

Symbolically compute forces due to constant bodyforce.

heatexpansion.py

Symbolically compute forces due to heat expansion.

jacobian.py

Symbolically compute jacobian of (iso-)parametric map.

laplacian.py 

Symbolically compute matrix of laplacian operator, e. g. for heat conduction, 
diffusion, etc.

lin_elasticity.py 

Symbolically compute stiffness matrix for small deformation, small rotation 
linear elasticity and forces arising due to uniform strain.

mass_matrix.py 

Symbolically compute mass matrix.

monomial.py 

Symbolically compute matrix of a monomial of order >2.
