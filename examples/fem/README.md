These directories contain different FEM demonstration cases. 

### `linear_elasticity`

Standard stationary, small-strain, small-rotations linear elasticity cases.

### `cahn-hilliard`

Solves transient Cahn-Hilliard equation via semi-implicite, mixed FEM.

### `heat_expansion`

Stationary, small-strain, small-rotations linear elasticity coupled with heat expansion
due to a uniform or non-uniform change in temperature.
